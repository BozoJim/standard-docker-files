# Standard docker-compose files for game servers

1. Clone the repo
1. `cd` into the directory for the game you are trying to run
1. Optionally make any minor tweaks to the docker-compose.yml for your setup.
1. Run `docker-compose up`, add `-d` to run it in the background, and your game should be running.
   - This assumes you have docker and docker-compose up and running.
